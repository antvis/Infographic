title: Built-in Patterns
---

Patterns are used to specify fill styles when the styling type is `pattern`, used as follows:

```json
{
  // Other configuration items...
  "themeConfig": {
    "stylize": {
      "type": "pattern",
      "pattern": "line" // Pattern ID
    }
  }
}
```

AntV Infographic has the following built-in patterns, and will continue to update and expand them:

- Line pattern (`line`): A pattern composed of parallel lines, suitable for expressing texture effects.
- Dot pattern (`dot`): A pattern composed of evenly distributed dots, suitable for expressing granular feel.
- Hexagonal pattern (`hex`): A pattern composed of hexagonal grids, suitable for expressing structured effects.
- Diamond pattern (`diamond`): A pattern composed of diamond grids, suitable for expressing geometric beauty.
- Mosaic pattern (`mosaic`): A pattern composed of irregular shapes, suitable for expressing diverse effects.
- Square pattern (`square`): A pattern composed of evenly distributed squares, suitable for expressing modern feel.
