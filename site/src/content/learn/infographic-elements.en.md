## Title {#title}

The title is the identifier of the core theme, used to convey content and purpose at first glance. It should be concise and eye-catching, typically placed at the top or in a prominent area.

## Data Item (Item) {#item}

Data items carry specific information and are the basic units of narrative. Multiple data items combine to form complete content.

Data items typically include the following sub-elements:

#### Item Label {#item-label}

The label is the identifying text of a data item, explaining the category, name, or dimension. Keep it brief and concise for quick recognition.

#### Item Description (Item Desc) {#item-desc}

The description supplements background or details, often containing values, percentages, or trend explanations, helping readers understand meaning and importance.

#### Item Icon {#item-icon}

The icon is the visual symbol of a data item, enhancing recognition through graphical representation. Appropriate icons can quickly convey type or characteristics, reducing cognitive load.

## Decoration {#decoration}

Decorative elements are used to optimize visual hierarchy, guide vision, or create atmosphere, such as background textures, dividing lines, and geometric color blocks. Use them moderately to avoid overshadowing the main content.

## Illustration {#illustration}

Illustrations are larger visual images that can assist in explaining themes or providing metaphors. Hand-drawn, flat, or realistic styles are all acceptable. The key is to complement text and data, making abstract information more concrete.
