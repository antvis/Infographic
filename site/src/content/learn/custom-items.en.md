title: Custom Items

Data item development also has a certain level of complexity. AntV Infographic has prepared a dedicated AI prompt for [data items](/learn/design#item), making it easy to quickly generate code using large language models.

## Development Prompt {#development-prompt}

The prompt is located in the [src/designs/items/prompt.md](https://github.com/antvis/Infographic/blob/main/src/designs/items/prompt.md) file in the AntV Infographic [GitHub repository](https://github.com/antvis/infographic). It contains the following:

- Core concepts of data items
- Design requirements (completeness, responsiveness, numerical processing)
- Technical specifications (type definitions, available components, utility functions)
- Code templates
- Theme color usage
- Gradient definitions
- positionH/V handling
- Common issues and best practices

> Usage is similar to [Custom Structure](/learn/custom-structure). Please verify the results in the Dev environment after generation.
