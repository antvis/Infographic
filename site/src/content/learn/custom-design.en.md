title: Custom Design
---

AntV Infographic supports customization in many areas, including Design, Templates, Themes, and Resources.

Among them, `structures` and `data items` are customized through [JSX DSL](/reference/jsx), with syntax similar to React components, allowing flexible extensions.

`Templates`, `themes`, `palettes`, and `resources` are completed through registered configurations or functions. You can choose programmatic extension or configuration extension based on your needs. See the respective customization sections for details.
