title: Infographic Theory
---

**Infographics** transform data, information, and knowledge into perceptible graphic language. It combines visual design with data visualization, using intuitive symbols to compress complex information, helping audiences quickly understand and remember key points.

Below are a text passage and an image. Try spending 10 seconds on each to extract information and compare your experience:

```md
At Alibaba, technical positions range from P5 to P10, with each level corresponding to different responsibilities and capability requirements.
P5 is an entry-level executor, mainly responsible for completing specific tasks, learning and growing under guidance;
P6 is an independent contributor, able to solve problems autonomously and deliver module-level work results; P7 begins to undertake more complex system design and project advancement, becoming a technical backbone in the team;
P8 needs to have architectural capabilities, lead the implementation of large projects, and form influence in their domain;
P9 is a technical expert or manager, responsible for cross-team strategic planning and resource integration, driving business innovation;
And P10, as an industry leader, must not only lead technical direction within the company but also set benchmarks in the industry, bringing profound technical and business value to the organization.

## Differences Between Infographics and Traditional Charts {#differences-between-infographics-and-traditional-charts}

| Dimension | Traditional Charts | Infographics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Main Purpose** | Precisely display data | Tell stories, convey insights |
| **Design Focus** | Functionality, accuracy | Visual aesthetics, narrativity |
| **Expression** | Standardized chart types | Free creative layouts |
| **Information Density** | Focus on specific datasets | Integrate multi-dimensional information |
| **Target Audience** | Professional analysts | Mass communication |
| **Visual Elements** | Mainly axes and grids | Rich in icons, graphics, decorative elements |

## Basic Characteristics of Infographics {#basic-characteristics-of-infographics}

### Visual Priority {#visual-priority}

Infographics are primarily visual. Typically, graphics account for about 60%, and text about 40%; in scenarios emphasizing visual impact, the graphics ratio can be even higher.

### Structured Organization {#structured-organization}

A complete infographic typically includes the following basic elements:

- **Title**: Summarize the theme, attract attention
- **Description**: Supplementary explanation, provide context
- **Data Items**: Core information units
- **Graphic Elements**: Decoration, enhance visual effects
- **Icons**: Semantic visual symbols
- **Connecting Elements**: Arrows, lines, etc., establish information relationships

### Clear Semantics {#clear-semantics}

Follow neutral design, use semantically clear and universal graphic symbols, avoid emotional or culturally specific elements, ensuring accurate and portable information.

### Clear Hierarchy {#clear-hierarchy}

Establish a clear visual hierarchy through color depth, graphic size, spatial layout, etc., guiding the audience to read and understand information in the sequence intended by the designer.

## Design Philosophy {#design-philosophy}

@antv/infographic is committed to making data storytelling simpler, more elegant, and more efficient. We believe:

- **Simplicity over complexity**: Avoid excessive decoration, let the information itself be the protagonist
- **Clarity over showmanship**: Pursue accuracy in information communication, not visual gimmicks
- **Balance professionalism and aesthetics**: Balance credibility and pleasure
- **Balance standardization and flexibility**: Provide out-of-the-box templates while supporting deep customization

By understanding these basic concepts, you will be better able to use infographics for data storytelling, making complex information simple and easy to understand.
